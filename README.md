# LAB - Class 37 & 38

## Project: Cookie Stand Admin - Leveling up Front End with React, Next.js & TailwindCSS

## Author: Bradley Hower

## Overview

In this lab, the webpage created is made to best emulate the mockup screenshot found at [Cookie Stand Admin Version 1](https://codefellows.github.io/seattle-code-python-401d24/class-37/lab/cookie-stand-admin-version-1.png). Webpage is made using Next.js, which is a framework that builds on top of TailwindsCSS and React.

Second update, added ability to add rows, as well as improve formatting to match second screenshot mockup found at [Cookie Stand Admin Version 2](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-38/lab/cookie-stand-admin-version-2.png).
