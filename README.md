In this lab, the webpage created is made to best emulate the mockup screenshot found at [Cookie Stand Admin Version 1](https://codefellows.github.io/seattle-code-python-401d24/class-37/lab/cookie-stand-admin-version-1.png). Webpage is made using Next.js, which is a framework that builds on top of TailwindsCSS and React.

Components are separated into their respective page.
